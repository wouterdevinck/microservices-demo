# MongoDB service

A microservice running a MongoDB server.

## Development only!

Note that this service is only meant to be used during development, e.g. when running all services locally on your development machine.
When deploying the services to the Kubernetes cluster, we configure them to use an as-a-service MongoDB cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
