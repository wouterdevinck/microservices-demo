# MongoDB service

A microservice running a MongoDB server.

## Not production ready!

Note that this service is a very simple example and only meant to run single-instance. Scaling and securing a production MongoDB cluster is a whole topic by itself.

In production, one could consider using a database as-a-service such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
